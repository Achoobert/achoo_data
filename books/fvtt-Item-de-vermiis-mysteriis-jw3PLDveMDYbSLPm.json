Some suspect the Ogham is a cipher used by Prinn to “hide” more revealing and blasphemous ideas. Rumors circulated in the early twentieth century concerning the Esoteric Order of Dagon, who were allegedly seeking an original copy of the book. It is believed that within the ciphered sections are formulae to hasten the metamorphosis of a human into a deep one.</p>",

For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. With success, the caster loses [[/roll 1D10]] Sanity points and the target loses [[/roll 2D10]] Sanity points. If the exchange fails, the caster must immediately cast the spell again (losing 10 more magic points) or his or her soul dissipates into eternity. Once the transfer is begun, it cannot be broken off.</p><p>A successful casting means that the caster has permanently taken control of the target&rsquo;s body. The caster&rsquo;s previous body is now a hollow, dead thing. As for the mind of the target, conjecture suggests that it is expelled from the body and thus dies; however, some hint that it remains inside its own body, subservient to the caster&rsquo;s mind and locked in a permanent state of horrific madness.</p><p><strong>Deeper magic:</strong> the dark will of wizards is a mighty thing, often transcending the very grave. Wizards, fearful of death or eager to ensure longevity, may prepare the Mind Transfer spell many years in advance of its casting. Such preparations usually concern some personal item (such as portrait or dairy), wherein the spell is keyed, awaiting the right conditions for it to come to fruition. Oft time, the key is found by some future descendant of the caster, who unknowingly or willingly activates the spell.</p><p><strong>Alternative names:</strong> The Mortal&rsquo;s Bargain, Ceaseless Vitality of the Blood, Soul Possession.</p>"
