He is a cynical and tough customer, ever on the lookout for suitably scandalous stories to print.</p><p>Mahoney knows the city intimately and has an extensive network of contacts from the underbelly of London life. If the investigators require the services of an expert safecracker, need to contact a shadowy underworld personality, or want to know if Inspector Barrington is an honest bloke, Mahoney is their man. The editor won’t necessarily impart such information freely, preferring a “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” approach to business dealings.</p><p>Mahoney and his newspaper provide the investigators with clues leading them into significant sections of the England chapter, although two of these are sidetracks. While the investigators can get by without ever interacting with Mahoney, his presence and the clues he can impart add great depth to the chapter and the Keeper is encouraged to ensure the investigators meet and befriend the man.</p><p>In contacting Mahoney the investigators may, unwittingly, bring about the editor’s downfall. Should Edward Gavigan (page 184) have sent cultists to keep an eye on the investigators, they will be tracked to The Scoop’s offices where the cultists ritually murder Mahoney. Such hostility from the cult could expand into Mahoney’s underworld contacts if the investigators have made use of them—the investigators could be harassed by both the criminal fraternity and the cult (something which may work particularly well in Pulp Cthulhu games).</p>","<ul><li>Description: overweight, with red hair and a wicked smile; normally surrounded by cigar smoke.</li><li>Traits: sharp and insightful, belligerent at times.</li><li>Roleplaying hooks: useful source of information and leads; the investigators may make him a potential victim of the Brotherhood.</li></ul> Accounting 65%, Climb 30%, Credit Rating 38%, Drive Auto 55%, Fast Talk 75%, History 35%, Jump 25%, Law 95%, Library Use 55%, Mechanical Repair 55%, Occult 10%, Persuade 65%, Psychology 60%, Spot Hidden 50%, Throw 30%.",1,60,30,0,10,11,45,45,55,65,40,50,70,70,45,65
Inspector_James_Barrington,Inspector James Barrington,1,Lead Detective on the “Egyptian Murders”,53,Male,Scotland Yard,modules/masks-of-nyarlathotep-data/assets/imgs/2_England/People/Inspector%20James%20Barrington.webp,James Barrington,"<p>Inspector Barrington is a weathered and seasoned policeman, usually dressed in a slightly shabby suit. He is a methodical man and plays by the book. He has been investigating the series of “Egyptian murders” for nearly a year, since the disappearance of his predecessor on the case (Inspector Munden). Dependent on what the investigators share with Barrington, his role in the campaign is flexible. While he is an unlikely replacement player character, he could be a useful ally. If he witnesses or hears about the investigators engaging in dubious activities, he may warn them that “excessive zeal” could put them in his firing line. Certainly, if necessary, Barrington isn’t beyond having the investigators picked up and formally warned; especially those who are foreigners acting like “cowboys,” who Barrington threatens with expulsion from England if their antics don’t calm down.</p> <p>If irrefutable evidence is presented in regard to the spate of murders, Barrington acts and employs the full force of the police, which may mean their heavy-handed tactics destroy valuable information pertinent to the investigators and their research. Once in police custody, key cult members are essentially out of reach of the investigators’ questions, so the players are best advised to think carefully before turning everything over to the authorities.</p> <p>Edward Gavigan is another matter. With compelling evidence, Barrington may attempt to hold him for questioning but Gavigan’s public standing and his solicitor, who utilizes all the legal tricks he knows, mean that most accusations are thrown out. Despite being unable to connect Gavigan to the murders, Zahra Shafik may not fare so well. Her position in society means that strong evidence may get her sentenced and locked up—if the investigators don’t end up in her clutches first!</p> <p>Inspector Barrington is something of a wildcard to be used as the Keeper desires to chastise or help the investigators. Remember, though, that Barrington’s key motivation is to solve the murders; anything else is secondary to accomplishing that. His investigation works in parallel with that of the investigators, which can either operate in the background or lead him to crossing their path.</p>

Edward_Gavigan,Edward Gavigan,1,High priest of the Black Pharaoh,55,Male,Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh,modules/masks-of-nyarlathotep-data/assets/imgs/2_England/People/Edward%20Gavigan.webp,Edward Gavigan,"<p>An intelligent and polished man of the English upper class, Gavigan is an astute and intelligent adversary. He is the main threat and villain of the England chapter.</p> <p>Outwardly to society, Gavigan is the director of the Penhew Foundation and a respected academic in matters of ancient Egyptian antiquities. Secretly, he is the high priest of the London branch of the Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh; a formidable sorcerer, he runs the organization with an iron fist.</p> <p>Though Gavigan is the epitome of an upper class and wealthy Englishman, he was relatively poor as a young man owing to a disagreement with his father, who withdrew Gavigan’s allowance. His interest in Egyptology eventually led him to the door of Sir Aubrey Penhew, where Gavigan spent many years scheming and dealing his way into Sir Aubrey’s confidence. Eventually, Sir Aubrey revealed to Gavigan the majesty of the Black Pharaoh; Sir Aubrey told Gavigan the return of the Black Pharaoh was imminent, and that Gavigan would play a significant role in the Great Plan. In time, Sir Aubrey departed with Roger Carlyle, leaving Gavigan in his stead as director of the Foundation and leader of the London Brotherhood. Gavigan defers to his old master, Sir Aubrey, in all matters; more so than in his dealings with Omar al-Shakti (A Dangerous Man, page 344), who Gavigan is convinced despises him (true; al-Shakti doesn’t trust the Englishman and would prefer Zahra Shafik to have total control of the London Brotherhood).</p> <p>Gavigan’s father died a few years ago and finally his inheritance, so long withheld, came to him. Now, he is independently wealthy and enjoys material life as much as he enjoys being empowered by the gods; favoring Savile Row tailored suits, elegant jewelry, and an expensive and new wristwatch (still a relatively new item of personal adornment).</p> <p>Relishing the power he commands as high priest, which goes hand-in-hand with the authority he demands as the Foundation’s director, Gavigan is well placed to ensure that the essential activities of the Brotherhood remain out of the public eye. The word of a respected academic versus that of a gaggle of unwashed (and possibly foreign) conspiracy theorists is a one-sided argument. At his word, the investigators can be barred from learned institutions, pilloried in newspapers, or named in libel lawsuits. If he can tie them to disastrous events in another country (New York City, or elsewhere if the investigators come to London later in the campaign), he may leak biased and very damaging stories about them to the press or police.</p> <p>Should the investigators attempt to pin anything on Gavigan, perhaps via Inspector Barrington (page 250), he may be brought in by the police for questioning but soon departs with his solicitor, who uses legal trickery and Gavigan’s public standing to get any accusations thrown out. Witness testimony is easily discounted for a man of Gavigan’s stature (or witness evidence can be retracted with suitable bribes or intimidation). While Barrington may believe the investigators, the detective will, ultimately, be frustrated and annoyed that the British legal system can’t make charges stick to a man like Gavigan.</p> <p>With enough incentive from the investigators, Gavigan could declare all-out war against them—kidnapping, break-ins, beatings, murder, and arson are all possibilities—that’s before he even thinks to utilize Mythos magic.</p> <p>Gavigan’s utter confidence may be his undoing. Focused on the delivery of machine parts for Sir Aubrey’s rocket (see the China chapter) and possibly distracted by the nuisance created by the investigators, he is unlikely to see the threat from Zahra Shafik (The Schemes of Zahra Shafik, page 259).</p> <h2>Skills</h2> <p>Accounting 30%, Anthropology 20%, Archaeology 60%, Charm 45%, Credit Rating 85%, Cthulhu Mythos 39%, Drive Auto 50%, History (Egyptian) 90%, Intimidate 40%, Listen 55%, Occult 65%, Persuade 80%, Psychology 90%, Ride 55%, Science (Astronomy) 40%, Spot Hidden 35%, Stealth 45%, Throw 60%.</p> <h2>Languages</h2> <p>Arabic 80%, English 90%, Egyptian Hieroglyphs 80%, French 80%, Greek 60%, Hebrew 40%, Hindustani 25%, Latin 70%.</p> <h2>Special</h2> <p>Gavigan has a pair of magic scepters (see Appendix D: Artifacts, page 651); normally kept at Misr House, Gavigan may have these nearby if he fears an attack is forthcoming.</p> <p>Spells: Cloud Memory, Contact Nyarlathotep, Dread Curse of Azathoth, Enchant Knife, Enchant Whistle, Flesh Ward, Mindblast, Pharaoh’s Breath*, Pharaoh’s Wrath*, Power Drain*, Quicken Fog-Spawn, Send Dream*, Shrivelling, Steal Life, Summon/Bind Byakhee, Summon/Bind Dimensional Shambler, Summon/Bind Hunting Horror, Summon/Bind Servitor of the Outer Gods, Voorish Sign, and others as the Keeper wishes.</p> <p>*See Appendix B: Spells.</p> <p>Armor: none, but the Two Scepters absorb 1D10 points of magical damage (e.g. if three Shrivelling spells were cast at Gavigan, the scepters would absorb 1D10 points of damage from each spell, each rolled separately).

From Empire Spices, her spice shop in Soho, Shafik controls most of the day-to-day operations of the London Brotherhood, essentially acting as Gavigan’s mouthpiece and enacting his will.</p> <p>Born and raised in Egypt, her talent for manipulation and keen intellect brought her to the attention of Omar al-Shakti, who nurtured her and brought her into the worship of the Black Pharaoh. In time, Shafik was sent to London to be Edward Gavigan’s high priestess, while also acting as al-Shakti’s eyes and ears. Occasionally, Shafik assists the Penhew Foundation, providing briefings on Cairo and Egyptian social customs for expeditions sponsored by the Foundation. She has made London her home and continues to monitor Gavigan and report back to al-Shakti, while directing the day-to-day activities of the cult’s rank and file from her store in Soho.</p> <p>Not content with being subordinate to Gavigan, a man she despises, Shafik aims to take control of the London chapter, eliminating Gavigan in the process. For some months, she has been recruiting followers loyal to her and not Gavigan. While content to bide her time until the moment is right to strike, she may see an opportunity with the arrival of the investigators and attempt to use them through guile and misdirection to achieve her goal. Shafik is not beyond employing magic to change her appearance to mislead, or to dominate the will of an investigator to implant a command to kill Gavigan (The Schemes of Zahra Shafik, page 259).
