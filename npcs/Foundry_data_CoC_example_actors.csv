Mickey_Mahoney,Mickey Mahoney,1,Editor of The Scoop,43,Male,The Scoop,modules/masks-of-nyarlathotep-data/assets/imgs/2_England/People/Mickey%20Mahoney.webp,Mickey Mahoney,"<p>Mickey Mahoney is a red-haired, cigar-smoking, and grubby journalist of Irish descent, who publishes The Scoop, a weekly tabloid specializing in printing stories about gory murders, sex scandals, and weird happenings. He is a cynical and tough customer, ever on the lookout for suitably scandalous stories to print.</p><p>Mahoney knows the city intimately and has an extensive network of contacts from the underbelly of London life. If the investigators require the services of an expert safecracker, need to contact a shadowy underworld personality, or want to know if Inspector Barrington is an honest bloke, Mahoney is their man. The editor won’t necessarily impart such information freely, preferring a “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” approach to business dealings.</p><p>Mahoney and his newspaper provide the investigators with clues leading them into significant sections of the England chapter, although two of these are sidetracks. While the investigators can get by without ever interacting with Mahoney, his presence and the clues he can impart add great depth to the chapter and the Keeper is encouraged to ensure the investigators meet and befriend the man.</p><p>In contacting Mahoney the investigators may, unwittingly, bring about the editor’s downfall. Should Edward Gavigan (page 184) have sent cultists to keep an eye on the investigators, they will be tracked to The Scoop’s offices where the cultists ritually murder Mahoney. Such hostility from the cult could expand into Mahoney’s underworld contacts if the investigators have made use of them—the investigators could be harassed by both the criminal fraternity and the cult (something which may work particularly well in Pulp Cthulhu games).</p>","<ul><li>Description: overweight, with red hair and a wicked smile; normally surrounded by cigar smoke.</li><li>Traits: sharp and insightful, belligerent at times.</li><li>Roleplaying hooks: useful source of information and leads; the investigators may make him a potential victim of the Brotherhood.</li></ul> Accounting 65%, Climb 30%, Credit Rating 38%, Drive Auto 55%, Fast Talk 75%, History 35%, Jump 25%, Law 95%, Library Use 55%, Mechanical Repair 55%, Occult 10%, Persuade 65%, Psychology 60%, Spot Hidden 50%, Throw 30%.",1,60,30,0,10,11,45,45,55,65,40,50,70,70,45,65
